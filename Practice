Practice S02P01: Speed of Sound
http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1010/4_misc/practice.html
Reference: Unit 5
Week of release: Week 4
Objectives: Writing function, using math function
Task statement:
Write a program speedOfSound.c that calculates the speed of sound s in air of a given
temperature T (in degree Fahrenheit). Formula to compute the speed s in feet/sec:
𝑠 = 1086 √
5𝑇 + 297
247
All values are of type float.
Your program should contain a function speed_of_sound() to compute and return the speed.
You are to decide on its parameter(s).
Sample run:
Temperature in degree Fahrenheit: 95.8
Speed of sound in air of 95.80 degree = 1924.92 ft/sec
